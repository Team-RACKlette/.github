# Team RACKlette 🧀

We are a group of motivated students from **ETH Zürich** with diverse interests in **high-performance computing (HPC)**.  
Our topics range from **low-level hardware tuning** to **algorithmic performance**, including:

- Parallel programming  
- Systems and administration  
- Algorithms and complexity  
- Processor and memory architecture  

The team is supervised by **Prof. Torsten Hoefler** and guided by **Hussein Harake**, whose experience in HPC supports and inspires our projects.  

💡 Our motivation:  
We enjoy exploring performance across the full stack, turning theory into practice, and learning from real-world supercomputing environments such as **CSCS** in Lugano.
