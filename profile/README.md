# Team RACKlette ðŸ§€

We are a team of motivated students from **ETH ZÃ¼rich** with diverse interests in **high-performance computing (HPC)**.  
Our work spans from **low-level hardware tuning** to **algorithmic performance optimization**, covering areas such as:

- Parallel programming  
- System administration & systems programming  
- Algorithms & complexity analysis  
- Processor & memory architecture  

The team is supervised by **Prof. Torsten Hoefler**, who supports us with his expertise and resources in HPC.  

ðŸ’¡ Our motivation:  
We love turning theory into practice, making things faster, and learning by exploring real-world supercomputing systems like **CSCS** in Lugano.
